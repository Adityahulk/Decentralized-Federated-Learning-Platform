# Decentralized Federated Learning Platform

## Description

Welcome to the Decentralized Federated Learning Platform GitHub repository! This project presents a proof of concept (PoC) for a decentralized federated learning platform leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as web3.0, IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), and smart contracts deployed on blockchain networks like Ethereum. Unlike traditional federated learning approaches that rely on centralized servers for model aggregation, our platform promotes decentralization and data privacy by distributing model training across participating worker nodes while ensuring the integrity of the process through smart contracts.

## Key Components

### 1. Smart Contract:
- Implemented on a blockchain network, the smart contract stores model information, data references (CIDs) uploaded to IPFS, and optional participant reputation scores for incentive mechanisms. It manages user registration, access control, training round initiation, model weight aggregation using FedAvg, and optional reward distribution.

### 2. Worker Nodes:
- Representing devices or servers, worker nodes run client applications interacting with the smart contract. They execute pre-processing and training code specific to the chosen model, download data from IPFS based on provided CIDs, and participate in the federated learning process.

### 3. IPFS:
- A decentralized storage network used for storing user data. Users upload their training data and receive a content identifier (CID), which is utilized by worker nodes for data retrieval during training.

## Workflow Overview

1. **User Registration:**
   - Users connect their web3 wallets, register with the smart contract, and upload their training data to IPFS to obtain CIDs.

2. **Training Initiation:**
   - A designated user or system process triggers a new training round through the smart contract, which broadcasts the initiation message to all registered worker nodes.

3. **Local Training:**
   - Worker nodes retrieve model information and training data from the smart contract and IPFS, respectively. They perform pre-processing, train local models, and calculate model updates.

4. **Model Update Sharing:**
   - Each worker node sends its model update (difference in weights) to the smart contract.

5. **Model Weight Aggregation:**
   - The smart contract aggregates model updates using FedAvg to obtain a global model update.

6. **Global Model Update Broadcast:**
   - The smart contract broadcasts the aggregated model update to all worker nodes.

7. **Local Model Update:**
   - Worker nodes receive the update and adjust their local models accordingly. This cycle repeats for multiple training rounds until a stopping criterion is met.

This GitHub repository serves as a central hub for collaboration, development, and discussion surrounding the Decentralized Federated Learning Platform.
